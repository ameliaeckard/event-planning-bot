By using the Event Planning Bot (the "Bot"), you agree to the following terms of service. If you do not agree to these terms, please refrain from using the Bot.

1. Use of the Bot
The Bot is intended for personal use on Discord servers for event planning purposes only.
Users interacting with the Bot are responsible for their inputs. Do not share sensitive or personal information via the Bot.
The Bot’s responses are automated and may not be monitored. Always verify event details with your server administrators.
2. Data Collection
The Bot collects and stores information such as Discord usernames, attendance responses, and selected options for event planning purposes.
Data is stored temporarily or in an associated file (e.g., Excel sheet) and will not be shared or used outside the scope of the server’s activities.
Server administrators are responsible for managing and safeguarding the data generated by the Bot.
3. User Responsibility
Users must not misuse the Bot, including spamming commands, inputting offensive content, or attempting to disrupt its functionality.
The server owner or administrators may restrict or ban users who violate these terms.
4. Bot Availability
The Bot is provided "as-is" with no guarantees of uptime, functionality, or bug-free operation.
The developer reserves the right to update, modify, or terminate the Bot's service at any time without prior notice.
5. Disclaimer
The Bot's developer is not liable for any damages, data loss, or issues resulting from the use of the Bot.
Use of the Bot is at your own discretion and risk.
6. Changes to These Terms
These terms may be updated periodically. Continued use of the Bot after updates constitutes agreement to the revised terms.
By interacting with the Bot, you acknowledge and agree to these terms. If you have any questions, contact the Bot developer or your server administrator.
