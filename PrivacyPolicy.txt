Privacy Policy
Last Updated: 11/15/2024

This Privacy Policy explains how the Event Planning Bot ("the Bot") collects, uses, and protects user data. By using the Bot, you agree to the practices described in this policy. If you do not agree, please refrain from using the Bot.

1. Data Collection
The Bot may collect the following types of data:

Discord Usernames: To identify participants in events.
User Inputs: Responses to attendance questions, item selections, or other event-related prompts.
Server Information: Limited metadata such as server ID or message IDs to facilitate Bot functionality.
How We Collect Data:

Data is collected when users interact with the Bot by reacting, sending messages, or using commands.
2. Data Usage
The collected data is used solely for the purpose of event planning and coordination within the Discord server where the Bot is active. This includes:

Tracking event attendance.
Logging user contributions (e.g., items they agree to bring).
Generating logs or reports (e.g., Excel files) for event organizers.
The Bot does not process or analyze the data for any purposes other than its stated functionality.

3. Data Storage
Event data is temporarily stored in memory while the Bot is running.
Long-term data (e.g., attendance logs, item selections) is saved locally in files such as Excel sheets on the server administrator's system.
The Bot does not store data in external databases or transfer data to third parties.
4. Data Sharing
The Bot does not share user data with third parties. Event data is only accessible to:

Server administrators where the Bot is installed.
The developer (if troubleshooting is required).
Server administrators are responsible for handling and protecting stored data.

5. User Rights
As a user, you have the following rights:

Access: Request information about what data has been logged by the Bot.
Correction: Request corrections to logged data if it is incorrect.
Deletion: Request the removal of your data from the event logs.
To exercise these rights, contact the server administrator.

6. Data Security
The Bot uses reasonable security measures to protect the collected data from unauthorized access or loss. However, no method of storage or transmission is completely secure, and users interact with the Bot at their own risk.

7. Third-Party Services
The Bot operates entirely within Discord’s ecosystem. Any interactions you have with Discord are subject to Discord’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

8. Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the Bot’s functionality or legal requirements. Continued use of the Bot after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

9. Contact Information
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, contact the server administrator or the Bot developer.
